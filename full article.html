</strong>

</h2>

<br><br>Manchester City have agreed to sell winger Leroy Sane to Bayern Munich in a deal that could earn them £54.8m.

<br><br>The Germany international will join the Bundesliga champions for an initial fee of about £44.7m, with add-ons which could increase it by more than £10m.

<br><br>Sane, 24, joined City from Schalke in 2016 for £37m and has claimed two Premier League titles with the club.

<br><br>He was a key part of the team that won a domestic treble last year, but has been injured for much of this season.

<br><br>City manager Pep Guardiola said last week that Sane, whose present deal was due to expire at the end of next season, had refused the offer of a new contract and wanted to leave.

<br><br>It is understood City were unwilling to get close to the estimated £20m annual salary Sane will receive from Bayern.

<br><br>City have negotiated a 10% sell-on clause, with the fee representing their largest ever outgoing transfer deal.

<br><br>The player is now set to travel to Germany in the next 24 hours to complete the transfer.

<br><br>Although he cannot play for Bayern in the Champions League this season, it is understood he will not return to City and has played his final game for the club.

<br><br>The Premier League club did have the option of keeping him for the final year of his contract, they felt it would have been counter-productive under the circumstances.

<br><br>Quite apart from the player's desire to leave, and potentially do so for nothing in 12 months' time, Sane is yet to prove his fitness after suffering a major knee injury during the Community Shield in August.

<br><br>City also believe they have are plenty of strength in wide positions, with Phil Foden, Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling all options.

<br><br>Sane has been in the matchday squad for all four City games since the season resumed earlier this month.

<br><br>However, his only appearance was for 11 minutes as a substitute in the 5-0 win against Burnley last Monday.

<br><br>Sane departs the Etihad having made 192 appearances for City, scoring 52 goals.
