		He was a key part of the team that won a domestic treble last year, but has been injured for much of this season.

	<br><br><h3><p class="text">Lionel Messi scored the 700th goal of his career with a Panenka penalty in Barcelona's La Liga draw with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.

		The Spanish giants' all-time top scorer hit the landmark goal for club and country by gently chipping the ball into the net as Jan Oblak dived the wrong way.

		The goal had put Barcelona 2-1 up but Atletico hit back to draw 2-2.

		Barca remain second, one point behind Real Madrid, who have a game in hand.

		Messi's penalty was also his 630th goal in his 724th appearance for the club.
